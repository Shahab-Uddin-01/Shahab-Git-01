            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and
                intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes
                Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The
                European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with
                the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In
                order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job
                skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved
                beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the
                employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.</p>
